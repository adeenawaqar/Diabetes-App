# Introduction:

This Diabetes Prediction Web App allows users to quickly predict the likelihood of diabetes based on common health parameters.

The app provides an interactive interface to input patient details like glucose, BMI, age, insulin level, and other measurements. 

It uses a machine learning model (or a dummy SVM for testing) to give predictions in real-time.

# Features:
Interactive User Input – Easy-to-use number input fields for key patient data: pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, BMI, age, etc.

Instant Prediction – Click the “Predict” button to get immediate results.

Flexible Inputs – Supports a wide range of realistic values for each health parameter.

Clear Result Display – Uses green/red messages to indicate low or high likelihood of diabetes.

# Results:

The patient is likely to have diabetes – Displayed as a red error message.

The patient is unlikely to have diabetes – Displayed as a green success message.
